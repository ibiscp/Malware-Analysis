# Malware Analysis

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to train different classifiers in order to separate malware from non malware applications running in an Android OS, given features extracted from the `manifest.xml` file and from the disassembled code.

The dataset that is being used here is the [The Drebin Dataset](https://www.sec.cs.tu-bs.de/~danarp/drebin/download.html) from the Braunschweig University of Technology.

The dataset contains 5,560 files from 179 different malware families. The samples were collected in the period of August 2010 to October 2012. More details on the dataset can be found in the [paper](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/Medien-DB/sec/pubs/2014-ndss.pdf) describing Drebin and the corresponding evaluation.

## Further improvements

For further improvements of this algorithm it would be interesting to tune the parameters of the classifiers, try to discard features that does not add relevant information about malware and non-malware examples and also, instead of just check if a word is in the file or not, count its the number of occurrences in the file.

Besides, an improvement can be done on the features extraction, the algorithm presented here is using just the most important word of each line of the document (`touchscreen` and `main`) and discarding words less relevant (`android`, `hardware`, `intent` and `action`) as the lines shown below. It would be interesting to use all the words and after that study the if this words are really not relevant or they can add any useful information to the classifier.

```
feature::android.hardware.touchscreen
intent::android.intent.action.MAIN
```
